# Geovisualization Documentation
Welcome to the introduction guide to **Asyncing Ship's Geovisualization program**. This documentation will help you get started with the set up process in order to use the program and show you how to implement geovisualization tools so that you can plot maps of different geographic regions and areas.


## Description
This program was designed to allow users to develop interactive chloropleth maps that utilize a GeoJSON file for reading the data and either .JSON or .CSV files in order to plot points and import data sets that will change the visual appearance of the map while creating an interactive UI for data science and software applications. The program enables users to load in two different files: 1. The data file that will generate the map's location (**GeoJSON**) & 2. The data file that holds the data that is to be plotted (**.JSON or .CSV**). Once these files are uploaded within the construct users can initialize their maps with a starting location, zoom values, as well as parameters that entail what geographic data is going to be used like the color, title of the map, legend name, etc. This is all completed with the Flask web API. The program receives the input from the user and the files are sent back as a post request and the program uses it to generate the contents of the map itself.

## Getting Started
These instructions will show you how to produce a copy of the project while also getting it up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### System Requirements 

__Requirements__

* A machine running Linux or Windows
* Anaconda with Python version >= 3.8.2
* Folium package
* Flask API
> NOTE: Folium is Python library that helps create several types of Leaflet maps

### Prerequisite Installation
1. Download and Install the latest version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) with Python >= 3.8.2

   or

   Pip install and run Pandas in Python
   ```
   $ pip install pandas
   ```
2. Pip Install [Folium](https://pypi.org/project/folium/)

   ```
   $ pip install folium
   ```   
   or
   ```   
   $ conda install -c conda-forge folium
   ```
3. Pip Install [Flask API](https://www.flaskapi.org/)

   ```
   $ pip install Flask-API
   ```
   
> NOTE: For Windows users it is suggested that you use Anaconda

> NOTE: For non-Windows you can easily install a python package manager, like pip, through Homebrew or use the apt-get command if you are using Linux

### Coding

__Coding Your Project__

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a Geovisualization program running

1. Upload your map using a GeoJSON format

   ```
   # provide absolute paths for GeoJSON from local machine
   json_path = '../data/GeoJSON/us_states.json'
   ```
> NOTE: An example of this file type can be located [here](https://github.com/Daechathon/EGR400-Geovisualization/tree/Development/data/GeoJSON)

2. Upload the data sets you want to map from various file types

   ```
   # provide absolute paths for dataset from local machine
   dataset1_path = '../data/Datasets/us_death_rates.csv'
   dataset2_path = '../data/Datasets/covid-19_cases.json'
   ```
> NOTE: The application currently takes in .csv and .json files (Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/Daechathon/EGR400-Geovisualization/tree/Development/data/Datasets))

> NOTE: Only takes two columns or keys with data


3. Upon running the application it will then generate your desired map with plotted data for spatial vectors and statistical data
**See Example Code "Map Generation"**
> NOTE: Generates an html which displays the user's map of choice

4. Map is saved to HTML

   ```
   # code block
   # Save to html
    m.save(html)
    first_path = os.path.abspath('./' + html)
    new_path = os.path.abspath('./templates/')
    shutil.move(first_path, new_path + '/' + html)
   ```
> NOTE: Could also be generated in browser with localhost


__Example Code: Files to Import__

To begin writing your file first import Pandas and Folium
   ```
   # code block
   import pandas as pd
   import folium as f
   import os
   import pathlib
   import shutil
   ```

__Example Code: Map Generation__

This function takes in the data sets of various file formats to generate a chloropleth map and plot the given data
   ```
   # code block
   def generate_map(geo_file, data_file, col, color, legend, html):
       geo_path = os.path.join(geo_file)
       data_path = os.path.join(data_file)
       data_read = ''
   ```
> NOTE: "geo_file" & "data_file" are the spaces where your .csv and .json files are placed

This reads in the file type 
   ```
   # code block
       ext = pathlib.Path(data_path).suffix
       if ext == ".csv":
           data_read = pd.read_csv(data_path)
       elif ext == ".json":
           data_read = pd.read_json(data_path)
   ```

Here lies the visual aspect within your generated map, which showcases your inputted data by color and layout plotting
   ```
   # code block
       m = f.Map(location=[37, -102], zoom_start=5)

       # Add the color for the chloropleth:
       m.choropleth(
           geo_data=geo_path,
           name='choropleth',
           data=data_read,
           columns=col,
           key_on='feature.id',
           fill_color=color,
           fill_opacity=0.7,
           line_opacity=0.2,
           legend_name=legend
       )
       f.LayerControl().add_to(m)
   ```
