# Geovisualization-documentation
Welcome to the introduction of **Asyncing Ship's Geovisualization program**. This documentation will help you get started with the\
set up process in order to use the program and show you how to implement geovisualization tools so that you can plot maps of different geographic regions and areas.


## Description
This program is designed to allow users to develop interactive chloropleth maps that utilize text files like CSV, JSON, XML, etc in order to plot points and import data sets that will change the visual appearance of the map they are creating. The program enables users to load in two different files: 1. The data file that will generate the map & 2. The data file that is to be plotted. Once these files are uploaded within the construct users can initialize their maps with a starting location, zoom values, as well as parameters that entail what geographic data is going to be used, the name of the map, legends, etc.
